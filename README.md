#Quantifying Introgression via Branch Lengths

``QuIBL`` is a program for detecting introgressed loci and characterizing introgression events in a species network. It takes a set of gene trees as input and estimates the proportion of introgressed loci as well as the timing of an introgression pulse triplet by triplet.
