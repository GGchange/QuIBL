# QuIBL
## Quantifying Introgression via Branch Lengths

``QuIBL`` is a program for detecting introgressed loci and characterizing introgression events in a species network. It takes a set of gene trees as input and estimates the proportion of introgressed loci as well as the timing of an introgression pulse triplet by triplet.

## Installation
Currently, ``QuIBL`` is distributed as a python script. To run it, ensure that you are using Python v2.7, and have installed the following dependencies:
``joblib``, ``ete3``, ``itertools``, ``sys``, ``numpy``, ``math``, ``ConfigParser``, ``csv``, ``joblib``, ``multiprocessing``
